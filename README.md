pandas library
lxml library

### Instructions

1. Ensure that your Excel file is in the correct format and in the same directory as the Python script. The expected format is provided in ['test_input.xlxs'](https://github.com/Dilara0880/generateXML/blob/main/test_input.xlsx).
2. Install all the requirements using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
3. Use `python script.py` to run the script with Python 3.8 or later.
4. The script will generate an XML file in the same directory, with the data from the Excel file.

### Features

- The script can handle Excel files with a specific structure and generates XML files with a specific structure.
- The script includes logging, with timestamps for each log message.
